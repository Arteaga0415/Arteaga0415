### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sebastian, a full-stack software engineer!

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/sebastian-arteaga-ronga/assets/desk-animation.gif" height=350>

As a software engineer, I thrive on the frontiers of technology, balancing in-depth backend solutions with intuitive front-end experiences. My journey has taken me from mechanical engineering to specializing in software development, where I've tackled everything from web scraping with Python and Selenium to full-stack development with TypeScript.

In my downtime, Iâ€™m an avid jiu-jitsu practitioner and an artist at heart, exploring the worlds of drawing, painting, and even tattooing with Procreate.

### What I'm working on

- Developing FlexMate, an app aiding gym owners in managing memberships.
- Contributing as a Full-stack Developer at Splitease, enhancing expense splitting experiences.
- Refining Reciplease with TypeScript, elevating culinary discovery through technology.

### Tools I've been wielding
